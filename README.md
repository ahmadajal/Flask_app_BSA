# Building a web service

We will learn how to make a web application with flask. We will start by building a simple `HelloWorld` web application which will run locally on your computer. Then we will see how we can use HTML to shape the different pages of our web app. Furthermore, we will see how we can pass parameters to our web application. Finally, we will see how we can deploy our web application into Google cloud app engine so that it is accessible from anywhere in the Web.

To get a more in-depth knowledge of Flask, we would recommend you to watch this nice <a href="https://youtu.be/mqhxxeeTbu0">tutorial series</a> on flask.

Moreover, you can also follow <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RbejfDTHhhg">this tutorial</a> in order to get to know more about deploying a Flask ML application on Google cloud.
